This is the snake game. The player controls the snake using the keyboard arrows. The keyboard arrows determine the direction the snake goes. The goal is for player to navigate the snake to eat the food that randomly appears on screen, and gain points while doing so. The player will advance in level if they win the round. The player must only eat the yellow food and avoid the red blocks. If the snake touches the red block, the game is over. If the snake goes out of bounds, the game is over. The highest scores will be recorded and shown before starting the game.
